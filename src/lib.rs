//!
//! This provided traits allowsto abstract the specific implementation of the GPIO peripheral access that
//! will be different on each specific embedded system. The provided function can be implemented individual the target /
//! hardware but keeps the implementation details away from crates that wants to use the GPIO peripheral for the 
//! functionality they provide.

//! One implementation for the Raspberry Pi could be found [here](https://crates.io/crates/ruspiro-gpio)
